# Flamma-sound-for-the-terminal
<br><br>
bash script for linux
<br><br>
It plays layered "flac" sound files to create a very nice fire sound indefinitely until "CTRL-C" is pressed at any time.
<br><br>
install "ffmpeg" first:
<br><br>
"apt-get install ffmpeg"
<br><br>
To run:
<br><br>
"bash FlammaX.sh"
<br><br>
Thank you!
